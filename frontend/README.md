This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

DNS address gives access to the DAO
DAO oversees 2 NFT contracts and 3 difi
NFT 1: Investing in projects.  As more web3 gains traction I not only see NFTs as a way to track personal assets, but also as a way to early seed funding.  Projects can offer off a percentage of their company as an NFT and investors can pool together to fund it, allowing the average joe and billion dollar hedgefunds to invest equally..

NFT 2: is a small 2% contribution from the advertising raised by members of the DAO, If I raise $100 dollars from advertisment $2 goes into the DAO to fund future projects


DAO involment with the NFTs
Any member of the DAO can reccomend an investmet oppertuity



Five party system to get the approval
The five parts of the DAO will make up the ecosystem
    1. Developers ("Those that are on the front lines building the projects")
    2. Finance ("Those that are investing in projects that hope to make financial gains")
    3. Start up ("The projects that are the life line of Donkey Betz")
    4. Marketing (" The people that truely believe in a project and are the ones that are bring in the the average people")
    5. Average People ("The absolute most important people in the world.  Every Finance person, Start-up or Marketing expert should look the Average Person as an corn, would you rather have one ear of corn or a kerrnel off of evey ear in the crop?  They also have to communicate between the developers and the average users")

    Each ecosystem will have it's own NFT, earlier minters of the DNS will get theirs air dropped for free
    Nft holders of each of the five sections can vote for who will have the governace token for
    Members can increase their voting power by contributions to the DAO
    No person can hold more than two consecutive terms as governace holders (This includes other DAOs that might have serval members, members of multiple DAOs should expect to represent just one.  Members must wait 4 terms before they can run for goverance again. If you leave a DAO while holding the goverance token of the DAO you represent you must wait 10 terms before running again.)


    The Five party system allows for growth in the ecosystem:
        1. Developers (while every developer has their own preferences for languages and frameworks they all have one thing in common, they love to build new things)
        2. Finance and Marketing should be able to explain the developers vision to the average person
        3. Start-ups will be allowed to mesh together, and find funding

    
    The DNS nft grants access to the DAO and also gives access to contribution rewards in the way of advertising
    NFTs can have a "Sponsored by section that allows advertisers to pay for a link in a users bio, The user will pay the DAO 2% of the to grow the plateform and fund other projects"

    Staking and Gambling:
    Staking funds into start ups
    Staking funds to be the house in a casino 


    Goverance Rewards: 
    If the section of the DAO brings in the most revenue for the term then every memmber of the marketing section of the DAO will be rewarded 
    This would encourage through research before members would start voting for project that could be scams
